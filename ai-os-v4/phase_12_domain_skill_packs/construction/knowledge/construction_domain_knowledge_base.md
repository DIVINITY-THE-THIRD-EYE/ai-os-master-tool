# Building Construction Logistics, Cost Estimating & Site Risk Controls

## 1. Domain Knowledge Repository Overview
This document serves as the authoritative knowledge base for **Construction Management** in the AI OS v4 platform. It encapsulates core theoretical principles, industry standards, standard architectural patterns, and critical anti-patterns necessary for high-precision autonomous operations.

---

## 2. Core Theories & Governing Frameworks

### 2.1 Domain Fundamentals
Operations in **Construction Management** are grounded in established scientific and engineering principles governed by **OSHA 1926, CSI MasterFormat, PMI PMBOK Construction, FIDIC Contracts**.

### 2.2 Domain System Metric Equation
- **Formula:** Domain Performance Score = (Verified Outputs / Total Resources) * Compliance Factor
- **Where:**
  - Compliance Factor = 1.0 if fully compliant with OSHA 1926.
  - Compliance Factor < 0.5 if any policy violation occurs.

## 3. Proven Industry Architectural Patterns

### Pattern 1: Modular Domain Layering
- **Description:** Decouple core domain logic from infrastructure adapters.
- **Application:** Use `Procore, Primavera P6, Autodesk Build, RSMeans Cost Data, HeavyBid, DroneDeploy` to implement strict separation of concerns.
- **Benefit:** Guarantees zero side-effect mutations during policy audits.

### Pattern 2: Defensive State Validation
- **Description:** Pre-validate all inputs and post-validate all outputs at subsystem boundaries.
- **Application:** Embedded directly in domain verification gates (`SPEC-P12-CONST-VRF-001`).

## 4. Critical Domain Anti-Patterns & Pitfalls

| Anti-Pattern | Description | Consequence | Corrective Action |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Bypass Verification Gate** | Skipping quality audit to save execution latency | Defective or non-compliant output reaching production | Mandate immutable kernel-level gate check |
| **Unbounded Parameter Drift** | Allowing operational variables to drift without recalculating constraints | System instability or regulatory breach | Enforce periodic re-calibration against OSHA 1926 |
| **Hardcoded Secrets / Constants** | Embedding static keys or hardcoded limits | Security vulnerability & maintenance overhead | Externalize all configuration via YAML schemas |

## 5. Key Domain Terminology & Glossary
- **CONST-Term 1:** Specific operational primitive in Construction Management.
- **CONST-Term 2:** Standard performance threshold defined under OSHA 1926.
- **CONST-Term 3:** Target quality benchmark required for enterprise deployment.
